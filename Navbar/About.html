        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2019, CraftConnect emerged from a simple belief: that handmade items carry a soul that mass-produced goods simply cannot match.
          Our founders, Sarah and Michael, were themselves artisans who struggled to find the right platform to showcase their work.
        </p>
        <p>
          What started as a weekend project in their garage has grown into a thriving marketplace that connects thousands of artisans with customers who
          value authenticity, sustainability, and craftsmanship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we're proud to support over 2,500 artisans worldwide, helping them turn their passion into sustainable businesses while bringing unique,
          meaningful products to homes everywhere.
